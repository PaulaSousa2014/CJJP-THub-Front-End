## Objectives of the Project

T-Hub is an LFG-type application directed only to T-Systems employees with the aim of encouraging internal networking, which can help build stronger relationships between employees and increase team cohesion.

## Basic Functionalities
T-Hub is a platform designed for T-System España employees, providing them with various features and functionalities to enhance their engagement and collaboration within the company. The following are the key functionalities offered by T-Hub:

- Corporate Profile
T-System España employees will have their own corporate profile on T-Hub. They can access the platform and customize their profile by indicating their workplace and office location.

- Common Feed
Upon logging in, users will have access to a common feed where they can create posts and share their thoughts with the entire T-Hub community. It allows users to stay updated with the latest news, announcements, and discussions within the company.

- Friend Requests and Networking
Users can build a network of friends and colleagues on T-Hub by sending and accepting friend requests. This feature enables users to create a more intimate circle of connections within the company. They can also comment, react, and respond to comments from their colleagues, fostering communication and collaboration.

- Group Creation and Participation
T-Hub provides the ability for users to create, edit, and delete groups in three different categories:

    - Games: Users can create game groups where they can chat, organize parties, and engage in discussions related to specific games.
    - Activities: Users can create groups for organizing outdoor activities such as cultural visits, bike rides, soccer matches, and more.
    - Social: Users can create groups to discuss specific topics of interest, such as reading groups, memes, off-topic conversations, and more.

- Group Search and Creation
Users can easily search for existing groups using the search engine within T-Hub. If the desired group does not exist, they have the option to create their own group, allowing them to connect with like-minded individuals and foster discussions on their chosen topics.

By leveraging these functionalities, T-Hub aims to facilitate networking, communication, and engagement among T-System España employees, creating a vibrant and collaborative community within the organization.
